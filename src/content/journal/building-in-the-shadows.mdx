# Building in the Shadows

Creating an underground platform requires the right tools and the wrong attitude.

## The Tech Stack

We chose technology that lets us move fast, break things, and maintain that raw, unpolished edge:

### Frontend Arsenal

- **React 19** - The latest and greatest
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast development
- **MDX** - Markdown with superpowers
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations

<Callout type="info">
  All open source, all customizable, all ours to hack.
</Callout>

## Why MDX?

MDX gives us the power to write content like markdown while embedding React components. It's the perfect blend of simplicity and flexibility.

```typescript
// Example MDX component usage
import { Callout } from '@/lib/mdx'

<Callout type="warning">
  This is how we roll—markdown meets JSX.
</Callout>
```

### Features We Built

1. **Dynamic routing** - Every post gets its own URL
2. **Frontmatter parsing** - Metadata for SEO and organization
3. **Syntax highlighting** - Code that looks as good as it works
4. **Custom components** - Callouts, images, embeds
5. **Reading time** - Because time is money (or chaos)

## The Design Philosophy

Our aesthetic is **cyberpunk meets brutalism**:

- Neon colors on dark backgrounds
- Glitch effects and distortion
- Monospace fonts for that terminal vibe
- Raw, unpolished edges

> "Design is not just what it looks like. Design is how it breaks things."

### Color Palette

```css
--cyber-black: #0a0a0a;
--neon-cyan: #00ffff;
--glitch-pink: #ff006e;
--glitch-green: #39ff14;
```

## Lessons Learned

Building underground doesn't mean building alone. Here's what we discovered:

- **Start raw, refine later** - Ship fast, iterate faster
- **Document nothing, explain everything** - Code comments are for the weak (just kidding, document your code)
- **Break conventions** - The best innovations come from breaking rules

<Callout type="warning">
  Warning: This approach may cause creativity, spontaneous innovation, and
  occasional chaos.
</Callout>

## What's Next?

We're just getting started. Coming soon:

- **Web3 integration** - Decentralized content hosting
- **AI experiments** - Generative art and music
- **Live streaming** - Underground broadcasts
- **Creator tools** - Build your own corner of the underground

## Open Source

Subcult is built in the open. Check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/subculture-collective) and contribute to the chaos.

**Keep building. Keep breaking. Keep creating.**
