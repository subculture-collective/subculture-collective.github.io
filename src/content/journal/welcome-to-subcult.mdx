# Welcome to Subcult

The underground doesn't die — it mutates.

## What is Subcult?

**Subcult** is more than a collective—it's a movement. A digital sanctuary for creators who refuse to conform, artists who challenge the status quo, and rebels who build culture from the shadows.

<Callout type="info">
  This is the beginning of something different. Something raw. Something real.
</Callout>

### Our Mission

We exist to:

- **Amplify** underground voices
- **Challenge** mainstream narratives
- **Build** alternative creative ecosystems
- **Connect** rebellious minds

## The Manifesto

> "In a world of algorithms and echo chambers, we choose chaos over conformity, substance over spectacle."

We believe in:

1. **Authenticity over aesthetics** - Raw truth beats polished lies
2. **Community over clout** - Real connections, not follower counts
3. **Creation over consumption** - Make, don't just watch
4. **Revolution over evolution** - Disrupt, don't iterate

### Code of the Underground

```javascript
const subcult = {
  rules: ['no rules'],
  vibe: 'chaotic creative',
  motto: 'create. disrupt. repeat.',
  status: 'underground',
}
```

## What We Create

From glitch art to experimental music, from indie games to avant-garde films—if it's underground, if it's bold, if it challenges the norm, it belongs here.

<Callout type="success">
  **Join the movement.** Create fearlessly. Be unapologetically you.
</Callout>
