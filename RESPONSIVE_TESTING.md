4. Test throttling: Fast 3G, Slow 3G
5. Use Lighthouse for performance audit
```

### Firefox DevTools

```
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Toggle Responsive Design Mode (Ctrl+Shift+M)
3. Test different devices
4. Use Screenshot feature for documentation
```

### Testing Script

Create bookmarklet to cycle through breakpoints:

```javascript
javascript: (function () {
  const w = window.innerWidth
  const sizes = [320, 375, 414, 640, 768, 1024, 1280, 1920]
  const next = sizes.find(s => s > w) || sizes[0]
  console.log(`Resizing to ${next}px`)
  // Note: Manual browser resize or use DevTools
})()
```

## üîß Quick Fixes Reference

### Horizontal Scroll Issue

```css
/* Add to problematic element */
.overflow-x-hidden
```

### Touch Target Too Small

```tsx
/* Increase padding */
className = 'p-3' // Instead of p-2
// Or add minimum size
className = 'min-w-[44px] min-h-[44px]'
```

### Text Overflow

```css
/* Add these utilities */
.truncate // Single line ellipsis
.line-clamp-2 // Multi-line clamp (if plugin installed)
```

### Image Overflow

```tsx
<img className="max-w-full h-auto" />
// Or use container
<div className="overflow-hidden">
  <img className="w-full object-cover" />
</div>
```

## ‚ú® Best Practices Reminder

1. **Test early, test often**: Don't wait until the end
2. **Test on real devices**: DevTools are great, but not perfect
3. **Test both orientations**: Portrait and landscape matter
4. **Test touch interactions**: Not just clicks
5. **Document issues**: Screenshots and descriptions help
6. **Verify fixes**: Re-test after fixing issues
7. **Test progressively**: Start mobile, work up to desktop
8. **Consider edge cases**: Very small or very large screens
