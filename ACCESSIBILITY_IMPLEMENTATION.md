# Accessibility Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Core Accessibility Components

- **VisuallyHidden Component** (`src/components/a11y/VisuallyHidden.tsx`)
  - Utility component for screen reader-only content
  - Uses proper CSS techniques to hide content visually while keeping it accessible
  - Can be used with any HTML element

### 2. ✅ Accessibility Statement Page

- **New Page** (`src/pages/AccessibilityStatement.tsx`)
  - Comprehensive accessibility statement documenting WCAG 2.1 AA commitment
  - Details all accessibility features implemented
  - Provides feedback mechanism for users
  - Accessible via `/accessibility` route
  - Added to footer navigation

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Forms

- **Autocomplete Attributes Added** to ContactForm
  - `autoComplete="name"` for name fields
  - `autoComplete="email"` for email fields
  - `autoComplete="url"` for URL fields
  - Helps users fill forms faster and reduces errors

### 4. ✅ Improved Focus Indicators

- **Enhanced CSS Focus States** (`src/index.css`)
  - Visible focus indicators with blue ring on all interactive elements
  - High contrast (neon-cyan/electric-blue on cyber-black)
  - Proper offset for visibility
  - Applied to buttons, links, inputs, textareas, and selects

### 5. ✅ Reduced Motion Support

- **CSS Media Query** for `prefers-reduced-motion`
  - Disables all animations for users who prefer reduced motion
  - Removes glitch effects for better accessibility
  - Already implemented React hook (`useReducedMotion`) used throughout

### 6. ✅ Accessibility Testing Workflow

- **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/accessibility.yml`)
  - Runs ESLint with jsx-a11y plugin on all PRs
  - Lighthouse accessibility audits automated
  - Results uploaded as artifacts
  - Minimum 90% accessibility score required

- **Lighthouse Configuration** (`lighthouserc.json`)
  - Focus on accessibility, best practices, and SEO
  - Runs on localhost during CI

### 7. ✅ Comprehensive Documentation

- **Accessibility Guide** (`ACCESSIBILITY.md`)
  - Complete guide to accessibility features
  - Testing procedures and tools
  - Maintenance guidelines
  - Component checklists for developers
  - WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance details

- **Updated README.md**
  - Added accessibility section
  - Quick reference to features
  - Testing commands
  - Link to full accessibility guide

## Already Implemented (Verified)

These features were already present in the codebase:

1. ✅ **Semantic HTML Structure**
   - Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
   - Semantic landmarks (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`)
   - Correct use of `<button>` vs `<a>` elements

2. ✅ **Keyboard Navigation**

   - Required fields marked with `aria-required`
   - Error messages with proper IDs and `aria-describedby`

   - electric-blue on cyber-black: 7.4:1 ✅
   - neon-green on cyber-black: 12.5:1 ✅

## Testing Performed

1. ✅ **Build Test** - Project builds successfully
2. ✅ **Lint Test** - ESLint passes with only pre-existing warnings
3. ✅ **Type Check** - TypeScript compilation successful
4. ✅ **Component Verification** - All new components properly typed
5. ✅ **Heading Hierarchy** - Verified proper heading structure across pages

## Next Steps for Complete WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

While the foundation is strong, here are recommended next steps:

1. **Manual Testing**
   - [ ] Test with NVDA screen reader (Windows)
   - [ ] Test with VoiceOver (macOS/iOS)
   - [ ] Test with JAWS screen reader (Windows)
   - [ ] Complete keyboard-only navigation test
   - [ ] Test with browser zoom at 200%

2. **Automated Testing**
   - [ ] Run axe DevTools on all pages
   - [ ] Run WAVE extension on all pages
   - [ ] Complete Lighthouse audit on production build

3. **Content Improvements**
   - [ ] Verify all images have descriptive alt text (not just generic text)
   - [ ] Add captions to any video content
   - [ ] Ensure link text is descriptive out of context

4. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Create accessibility statement for production site
   - [ ] Add accessibility testing to contributor guidelines
   - [ ] Schedule quarterly accessibility audits
